# Analyze-AB-Test-Results


A/B test is the third project in Data Analyst Nanodegree. 
In this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company decide if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Project Parts 

- Probability
- A/B Test
- Regression
- Conclusions


## Tools 

- Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Random and Statsmodels.api.
- Jupyter notebook.



>This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
